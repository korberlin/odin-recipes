    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This strikingly delicious pumpkin-black cocoa swirl Bundt cake packs a flavor punch thanks to black cocoa. Not
        only does it make for a wonderfully dark color, but it also adds a flavor reminiscent of Oreo cookies!

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour, such as
            Baker's Joy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, beat butter, oil, and 2 cups white sugar on medium-high speed with an electric mixer
            until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. After adding in
            the last egg, beat mixture on medium-high speed until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Add in pumpkin and
            vanilla, and mix until incorporated. Reduce mixer speed to low; pour in half of dry ingredients, and mix
            until just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix
            until just combined.

        </li>
        <li>Measure out 3 cups batter into another bowl. To this 3 cups batter, add 3 tablespoon black cocoa powder,
            unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons sugar, milk, espresso powder, and melted semi-sweet chocolate. Mix
            on low speed until combined.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 of black cocoa batter into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan. Pour 1/2 of
            plain pumpkin batter over the black cocoa layer. Add another 1/3 of black cocoa batter over the top of plain
            pumpkin batter. Layer remaining 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over that. Finish with remaining 1/3 of the
            black cocoa batter.</li>
        <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly
            clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool in pan 25 to 30 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to
            cool completely.</li>
