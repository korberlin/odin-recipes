    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This shish kabob is made with chunks of marinated beef, mushrooms, and vegetables and cooked on the grill.
        This recipe is the one my mom has cooked for as long as I remember. She would probably be upset that
        I shared the recipe, but it is so delicious that I think everyone should have a chance to experience it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
